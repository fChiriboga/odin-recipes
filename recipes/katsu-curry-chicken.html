		<h1>Katsu Curry Chicken</h1>
        <p>This recipe is a classic Japanese dish full of warmth and comfort. This meal can be enjoyed year round but is best during cold weather. 
            Although this recipe is made with chicken, it can be substituted with any other protein source. For this recipe I used a ready-made curry roux. 
            There are many varieites of curry roux that can be used, but for this recipe I used the Golden Curry mix in mild.</p>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 400 Degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Wash rice and place in either a rice cooker or pot and add the water(if using a pot, add 1/4 cup more water). Rice should cook for about 20 minutes.
                Once done, check rice to make sure it has been fully cooked. If still hard, add 1/4 cup more water and wait another 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Heat up another pot for the curry. Dice onion, peel carrots and cut them into thin rounds. Once pot is hot add olive oil, onions and carrots.</li>
            <li>Peel and cut potatoes into 1 inch cubes. Once oinions have softened, add in potatoes, water, and curry squares.</li>
            <li>Stir until curry has fully dissolved and let it simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Curry will be done when the potatoes and carrots are fork tender.</li>
            <li>To prepare the dredge for the chicken, get 3 bowls. One bowl will have the flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 
                1 tbsp onion powder and 1 tsp of MSG. Another bowl will have 2 beaten eggs and the rest of the salt and pepper. 
                The third bowl will have the bread crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>On a flat surface, pound the chicken until thin and dredge each thigh in first the flour mixture, then the egg, and finally the bread crumbs. 
                Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes check to make sure chicken is fully cooked. If it's still pink in the middle, baked for another 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>To serve, place rice in a bowl filling only half of the bowl and ladel the curry in the other half. Slice chicken and place on top of rice.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
